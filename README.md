# WorkDays

Calculate the number of business days in a given period.  Also, add convenience methods to Range, Date, and Time.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'work_days'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install work_days

## Usage

Use your own custom work schedule by creating a class implementing
your custom holiday methods and including the WorkDays::CalculationMethods module
(and optionally the WorkDays::HolidayMethods module for a few of the presets).

    class SampleSchedule
      include WorkDays::CalculationMethods
      include WorkDays::HolidayMethods

      def observed_holidays
        [:new_years_day, :christmas_day]
      end
    end

Then tell the library to use your new schedule:

    WorkDays.work_schedule = SampleSchedule.new

You can also use a few pre-built schedules (WorkDays::WorkSchedules::Default, WorkDays::WorkSchedules::Bank).

By default a day is considered a work day as long as it is a week day and it isn't a holiday.
You can configure your own week days by overriding the week_day? method in your work schedule class.

### Methods

These methods can be called either on an instance of your work schedule class or directly
on the WorkDays module (as long as you set the WorkDays.work_schedule).

* work_day?(date)
  * Returns true for week days as long as it isn't a holiday.
* non_work_day?(date)
  * The opposite of work_day?.
* work_days_in_range(start_date, end_date)
  * Returns an array of the work days between the start and end dates.
* work_days_in_month(date)
  * Returns an array of the work days for the year and month of the passed in date.
* holiday?(date)
  * Returns true for any date that is an observed holiday.
* holidays_in_range(start_date, end_date)
  * Returns an array of the holidays between the start and end dates.
